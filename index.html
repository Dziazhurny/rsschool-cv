           <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>Currently I work for an international company as a safety engineer. Before I started working for this company I had worked as a civil servant. I always develop my skills in topics that are interesting to me and due to the fact that I have no ability to develop my skills more in the field that I work now I started looking for something new. I have many friends that are working in IT and their experience affected my choice. So I decided to try myself in this sphere and found out that I really like it. I started from learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by advice of my friends who work as Front-End web developers. I have taken online trainings such as HTML Academy, courses and trainings on YouTube, have read the book on learn.javascript website, Васильев А.Н. Программирование на Java Script в примерах и задачах и др. I would really like to make my knowledges in IT deeper and I think that EPAM courses is a great opportunity in achieving this aim.</p>
           <h2>Skills</h2>
           <p>I will list everything that I have already worked with, albeit not at a high level, but still.</p>
           <ul class="skills">
               <li>HTML</li>
               <li>CSS</li>
               <li>JavaScript</li>
               <li>GIT</li>
               <li>VS Code</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>Code examples</h2>
           <p>For now I haven’t done any big protects. I have just tried to write codes and one of them is my CV.</p>
           <h2>Education</h2>
           <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript courses</p>
           <h2>English</h2>
           <p>I experience English at work since I work for an international company. Also I develop my English by self learning with help of plenty of apps, furthermore I take lessons from a tutor.</p>
