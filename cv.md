1. **Summary** </br>
  Currently I work for an international company as a safety engineer. Before I started working for this company I had worked as a civil servant. I always develop my skills in topics that are interesting to me and due to the fact that I have no ability to develop my skills more in the field that I work now I started looking for something new. I have many friends that are working in IT and their experience affected my choice. So I decided to try myself in this sphere and found out that I really like it. I started from learning  HTML, CSS and JavaScript by advice of my friends who work as Front-End web developers. I have taken online trainings such as HTML Academy, courses and trainings on YouTube, have read the book on learn.javascript website, Васильев А.Н. Программирование на Java Script в примерах и задачах и др. 
I would really like to make my knowledges in IT deeper and I think that EPAM courses is a great opportunity in achieving this aim.
